# OSlab1 -- Dylan Sarell -- 10/31/22

  For my First operating Systems Lab, this was inherrantly difficult. I have put numerous hours into this Assignment throughout the past week and there was so much new code that I have not seen before. To be honest I am still not sure if I have the Program fully working, but I got it to output something. In this assigment the Job was to create a program invloving the Producer Consumer Problem. It was to create two separate processes, a producer and a consumer, connecting them with shared memory. 
  
  In my program, the Producer will generate 2 random numbers (between 0 and 99), and store them into the buffer.
